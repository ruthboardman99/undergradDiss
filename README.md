This repository contains code used in my undergraduate dissertation at the University of Exeter, with the title: An investigation of economic inequalities amongst ethnic minorities and the impact of employment type in the United Kingdom during the Covid-19 pandemic. The code uses mainstage and COVID-19 data from Understanding Society.
